**PatientSync is a desktop application meticulously crafted for nurses who prioritize the well-being of their patients above all else.**  
It allows you to input intimate details about your patients, such as food preferences and family conditions. While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using PatientSync, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing PatientSync, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
