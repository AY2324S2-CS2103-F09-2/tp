**PatientSync is a desktop application meticulously crafted for nurses who prioritize the well-being of their patients above all else.**\
It allows you to input intimate details about your patients, such as food preferences and family conditions. While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
